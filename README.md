### Project Goal: 

  Our application, Pastyle, is an artistic stylizer platfor that allows users to upload a photo of their choice, select an artistic style, and have the selected style transferred to their content photo. Users will have the option to purchase their stylized photo, share their photo on social media, or have it printed on canvas. The style transfer is completed using a machine learning style transfer API. 
  

### Our Machine Learning Style API:
  The machine learnign style API that we use in our system to apply the styles to user content photos is a Fast Style Transfer in TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a library of numerical computations using data flow graphs that is installed on the system server. TensorFlow is used to train the fast style transfer network.
